What should be done (TODO)
--------------------------

 - Add database abstraction and support for SQLite and
   flat file/yaml (yaml for metadata, a flat file for the code)
 - add a list of all public pastes
 - Show the uploader's gravatar image
 - Add an backend where you can delete spam and see all pastes (not only the public ones)
 - Add a login/registration and and let the admin force the users to login if he wishes so.
 - Add a comment function
 - Add "code replies" (i.e. pastes that are corrections or whatever for other pastes)
